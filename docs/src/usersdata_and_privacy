# Privacy Concerns
The bot itself does not collect any special data. The bot is open source so you can actually view how it does *everything*.
The website is mostly what will be discussed in this section.

To start: Violations to another users privacy is strictly 

## How your location data is collected and stored.
Information about where you are is derived from the IP address using a MaxMind GeoLite2 Country database. 
This means that:
1. Due to the data effectively being an educated guess, it's not reliable.
2. Only information about your *country* is available. Not even timezone is asked for.

These are both wins for your privacy.

This information is collected whenever you join an event, and is temporarily stored under your profile in our database. However, this raw data is not accessible to users.\
In fact, all location data is anonymized as soon as a session ends. So that means that other users (such as a host) can not know which user joined from which country. All they know is X amount of users joined from X country.

## Comet is not a doxxing service
Location data is collected strictly for analytics purposes, and attempting to use our service to deduce the location of a user is strictly against our policy.

To prevent this, we take several measures:
1. **Location data is not recorded for sessions with a low number of attendees.** This makes it much harder to deduce the location of attendees. One can not start an event for only one attendee.
2. **User consent.**
    1. The first time a user joins a session on Comet, it asks for their express permission to include their anonymous location data. They can change this setting at any time
    2. A user can stop a specific server from receiving their anonymous location. They can change this setting at any time.

Welcome to the Donut wiki!

This includes most of the information you need about the bot, including how to use it.
Issues with the bot belong in [the issues tab](https://github.com/Hypurrnating/Donut/issues), and other general discussion goes [in the discussions tab](https://github.com/Hypurrnating/Donut/discussions).

Donut is more of a multipurpose Discord bot; at the moment the key feature is the `events` group. These commands are centered around Roblox Discord servers that host frequent sessions and helps them streamline the process by making it quick to set up events and recording key information about the event itself to provide useful statistics. The bot makes things easier by:
- Setting up an embed where members can register interest for an event.
- Notifying interested users when an event starts.
- Verifying the Discord users with their Roblox accounts as they join.
- Collecting anonymous location and device data from users that join. 
- Posting detailed logs (also helps with staff management)

# Welcome to the Donut Docs

This includes most of the information you need about the bot, including how to use it.

Donut is more of a multipurpose Discord bot; at the moment the key feature is the `events` group. These commands are centered around Roblox Discord servers that host frequent RP sessions and helps them streamline the process by making it quick to set up and records key information about the event as it goes. 

Key features include:
- User created templates which allow for:
    - Customization
    - Faster session start up
- Announcement embeds where members can register interest for an event.
- Notifying interested users when an event starts (via dm).
- Verifying the Discord users with their Roblox accounts as they join.
- Collecting anonymous location and device data from users that join. 
- Posting detailed logs about events.

The bot is an open-source project. Please read the license before forking/copying.

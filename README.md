The bot itself is free to use.

I made this because I really just like to code things and I figured a project like this would be helpful to some Roblox RP servers out there.
Games like ER:LC have massive communities and (overkill) bots that are complete with web dashboards and native APIs for their games(!). The 
problem I ran into while making custom bots for some very nice servers, was that they all wanted the same things, in a "custom" bot. This led 
to multiple bots being made, and together they felt like clusters of spaghetti code. Eventually I realized many servers only wanted a custom
name and theme.

Now that you have the lore, you can understand what the purpose of this bot is. To put an end to this sillyness. 
This bot uses webhooks to send messages to channels, so that servers can customize it. But behind the scenes, it's mostly the same. The benefit
of this is that the bot easier to maintain, and host. Economies of scale and all that.
